ZOTTERPOINT

Google extension with the intended purpose of helping students in a lecture indicate uncertainty to a professor through reactions/questions on a google slide show.
If enough people are confused about something, that can be propagated all the way to the live presentation, allowing the professor to respond to it in real time.
